### âœ… Port Standardization
- [x] User Service: External 3000 â†’ Internal 3000
- [x] Product Service: External 3001 â†’ Internal 3001 (fixed from 3001:3000)
- [x] Order Service: External 3002 â†’ Internal 3002 (fixed from 3002:3000)
- [x] Payment Service: External 3003 â†’ Internal 3003 (fixed from 3003:3000)
- [x] API Gateway: External 4000 â†’ Internal 4000 (consistent)
- [x] Frontend: External 3005 â†’ Internal 3000 (consistent)
- [x] Expiration Service: External 3006 â†’ Internal 3006 (added)

### âœ… Dockerfile Standardization
- [x] All services use `node:18-alpine` base image
- [x] Consistent WORKDIR structure
- [x] Standard package installation process
- [x] Health checks added to all services
- [x] Proper EXPOSE directives
- [x] Consistent CMD instructions

### âœ… Docker Compose Configuration
- [x] Added container names for better identification
- [x] Implemented health checks for all services
- [x] Added proper service dependencies with health conditions
- [x] Standardized environment variables
- [x] Added volume mounts for development hot reload
- [x] Configured proper restart policies
- [x] Added infrastructure service health checks

### âœ… Environment Configuration
- [x] Created `.env.local` for local development
- [x] Updated `.env` with standardized variables
- [x] Created `.env.prod` template for production
- [x] Fixed MongoDB URIs for local development
- [x] Standardized service URL configurations

### âœ… API Gateway Updates
- [x] Updated service URLs to use correct internal ports
- [x] Fixed routing configuration
- [x] Added proper health check endpoints

### âœ… Scripts and Automation
- [x] Created `start-standardized.sh` for development startup
- [x] Created `stop-system.sh` for clean shutdown
- [x] Updated `health-check.sh` with correct ports
- [x] Made all scripts executable

### âœ… Production Configuration
- [x] Created `docker-compose.prod.yml` with optimized settings
- [x] Added resource limits and reservations
- [x] Implemented proper networking
- [x] Added security configurations
- [x] Created production Dockerfile templates

### âœ… Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive `DOCKER_STANDARDIZATION.md`
- [x] Added troubleshooting guides
- [x] Documented port mappings
- [x] Included monitoring commands

## ðŸ”„ Verification Steps

### 1. Configuration Validation
```bash
# Validate Docker Compose syntax
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml config --quiet
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config --quiet
```

### 2. Service Port Verification
```bash
# Check port conflicts
lsof -i :3000,3001,3002,3003,3005,3006,4000,27017,6379,4222
```

### 3. Environment Variables Check
```bash
# Verify environment files
cat .env.local | grep -E "(PORT|URL)"
```

### 4. Script Functionality
```bash
# Test script permissions
ls -la start-standardized.sh stop-system.sh scripts/health-check.sh
```

### 5. Health Check Endpoints
After starting services, verify:
- http://localhost:3000/health (User Service)
- http://localhost:3001/health (Product Service)
- http://localhost:3002/health (Order Service)
- http://localhost:3003/health (Payment Service)
- http://localhost:4000/health (API Gateway)
- http://localhost:3005 (Frontend)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Test Full System
```bash
./start-standardized.sh
# Wait for all services to start
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

### 2. Verify Service Communication
- Test API Gateway routing to all microservices
- Verify frontend can connect to API Gateway
- Check NATS messaging between services
- Validate database connections

### 3. Production Preparation
- Update `.env.prod` with actual production values
- Create production Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds
- Set up proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure production monitoring

### 4. Performance Testing
- Load test API Gateway
- Verify resource usage within limits
- Test service startup times
- Validate health check responsiveness

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Criteria

The standardization is complete when:

- [x] All services use consistent port mapping
- [x] All Dockerfiles follow the same pattern
- [x] Environment variables are properly organized
- [x] Health checks work for all services
- [x] Scripts can start/stop the system cleanly
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Full system test passes
- [ ] All services communicate properly
- [ ] Health monitoring works end-to-end

## ðŸ“Š Key Improvements Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All services now follow the same patterns
2. **Maintainability**: Standardized configuration makes updates easier
3. **Reliability**: Health checks ensure service readiness
4. **Scalability**: Production configuration with resource limits
5. **Developer Experience**: Simplified startup with comprehensive scripts
6. **Monitoring**: Built-in health monitoring and troubleshooting tools
