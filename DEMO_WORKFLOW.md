  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123","name":"Test User","gender":"male","age":25}'

# User Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/users/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'
```

### Product APIs
```bash

# Create Order (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=..." \
  -d '{"cart":[{"productId":"...","quantity":1,"color":"Blue","size":"128GB"}]}'

# Get My Orders
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/orders/myorders \
  -H "Cookie: session=..."
```
